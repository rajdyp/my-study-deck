1. External Clients: These are external users or systems sending requests to your application.

2. Ingress Service: The Ingress Service is a Kubernetes Service resource. It acts as the entry point for external traffic into your Kubernetes cluster. It forwards incoming external traffic to the Ingress Gateway Pod.

3. Ingress Gateway Pod: The Ingress Gateway Pod runs an Envoy proxy (or another suitable gateway). It is responsible for receiving, routing, and processing incoming external traffic. This pod is part of your Istio service mesh and is deployed in your Kubernetes cluster.

4. Gateway Resource: The Gateway Resource is an Istio resource. It defines how incoming external traffic is routed to specific Virtual Services based on host/path rules. It allows Istio to configure how external traffic is directed within the service mesh.

5. Virtual Services: Virtual Services are another Istio resource that further routes incoming external traffic to internal Destination Services based on the defined routing rules. Virtual Services map external traffic to internal services within the Istio service mesh.

6. Destination Services: Destination Services are your application's internal services within the Istio service mesh. They serve as the final destination for external traffic. These services receive the traffic from the Virtual Services and process it.

7. DestinationRule (Internal): After traffic has reached the Destination Services, the DestinationRule comes into play. It is used to configure policies and settings for the internal communication between services within the Istio service mesh. The DestinationRule specifies how services should handle traffic when communicating with each other.
