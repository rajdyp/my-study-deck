```yaml
Step 1: Sign in to AWS Console
```

```yaml
Step 2: Choose a Region
```

```yaml
Step 3: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

| --> Go to the VPC Dashboard
|    | --> Click "Create VPC"
|    |    | --> Check "VPC and more"
|    |    | --> Provide a name "mirik" and a CIDR block "10.10.0.0/16." for the VPC 
|    |    | --> Create public, private, and database subnets during the VPC creation or later from the subnets section
|    |    | --> # create VPC endpoints for S3 Gateway
```

```yaml
Step 4: Set Up Security Groups

| --> In the VPC/EC2 Dashboard, navigate to "Security Groups" on the left
|    | Click "Create Security Group" and give it a name and description
|    | Configure inbound and outbound rules to allow or deny traffic based on your requirements. For example, allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) for the public tier.
```

```yaml
Step 5: Launch EC2 Instances (Web Servers)

In the EC2 Dashboard, click "Launch Instances."
Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) based on your operating system and application needs.
Choose an instance type based on your performance requirements.
Configure network settings, including the VPC and security group you've created.
Review and launch the instance, creating or selecting an existing key pair for SSH access.
```

```yaml
Step 6: Configure Load Balancers

In the EC2 Dashboard, go to "Load Balancers."
Click "Create Load Balancer" and choose the Application Load Balancer (ALB).
Configure the listeners (e.g., HTTP on port 80) and create a new target group to manage traffic to your web servers.
Associate your ALB with the public subnet you created earlier.
```

```yaml
Step 7: Launch Application Servers

Similar to web servers, launch instances in the private subnet for your application servers.
Choose an appropriate AMI, instance type, and configure security groups.
Ensure these instances can communicate with the web servers and the database.
```

```yaml
Step 8: Implement an RDS Database

In the RDS Dashboard, click "Create Database."
Choose the database engine you need (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Configure the database details, such as the database instance class, storage, username, and password.
Under the "Network & Security" section, select the VPC and configure the security group to allow access only from the application servers.
```

```yaml
Step 9: Set Up Auto Scaling

In the EC2 Dashboard, navigate to "Auto Scaling Groups."
Create a new Auto Scaling group for your web servers or application servers.
Configure scaling policies, such as scaling based on CPU utilization, and define the minimum and maximum number of instances.
```

```yaml
Step 10: Enable Monitoring and Logging

In the CloudWatch Dashboard, set up alarms to monitor your resources, such as CPU utilization and response times.
Enable logging for your services, like web server access logs and database query logs.
```

```yaml
Step 11: Implement Backup and Disaster Recovery

Configure automated backups for your RDS instance in the RDS Dashboard.
Create a backup retention policy to specify how long backups are kept.
Consider implementing Multi-AZ deployments for high availability and create read replicas for disaster recovery.
```

```yaml
Step 12: Implement Security Best Practices

In the IAM Dashboard, set up IAM roles for your EC2 instances to grant them necessary permissions to AWS services.
Regularly update security patches on your EC2 instances using Systems Manager or other methods.
Consider enabling AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield for additional security.
```

```yaml
Step 13: Test and Optimize

Continuously test your architecture for performance, security, and reliability.
Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor costs and optimize resources for cost-efficiency.
This detailed guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating each component of a three-tier architecture in AWS using the AWS Management Console. Remember to refer to AWS documentation and adapt these steps to your specific use case and requirements.
