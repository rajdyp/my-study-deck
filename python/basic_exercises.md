     - Merge dictionary with any other dictionary
     - Update student age to 18
     - Delete grades
     - List all keys
     - List all values
     - Iterate and print all keys
     - Iterate and print all values
     - Iterate and print both keys value pairs
     - Remove all items
5. Create an empty set `set1` and assign it to a variable.
     - Add three items
     - Create a second set `set2` with at least one common item with the first set
     - Find the union, symmetric difference, and intersection of the two sets
     - Create a sequence of numbers using range, then ask the user to enter a number.
          - Inform the user whether or not their number was within the specified range.
          - Also tell the user if their number was too high or too low.
6. Split `"was it a car"` to `'w', 'a', 's', 'i', 't', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'r'`
7. Add first and last name without string concatenation.
8. For integer `n = 5` without using any string methods, print `12345`.
9. Convert `"Hello word !"` into `helloworld!`.
10. Convert given list `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
11. Reverse the string `"Hello World"`
12. Remove duplicates from the given list: `mylist = ["a", "b", "a", "c", "c"]`
13. Split integer `1234` into digits `1 2 3 4`
14. Find sum of digits of a number `888`.
15. Break any text to a list of words.
16. Add tuple to an existing list.
17. Convert list to tuple and tuple to list.
18. For the sequence of digits `5893804115457289`, take the digits at each of the even indices (0, 2, 4, 6, etc.) and double them.
19. Reverse the order of the digits `5893804115457289` using list.
20. Print values in list along with its index `nums = [2,7,11,15]`
21. Take the set of CSV data and split them into rows.
```yaml
sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.9,3,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
```
21. Check for leap year.
```yaml
In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
- The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless
- The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless
- The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
