4. Create a dictionary called `student`, wherein student name is `"John Smith"` and his grades are `88, 76, 92, 85, 69`.
     - Print student grades
     - Add student age
     - Print `John Smith is 14 years old and his grades are 88, 76, 92, 85, 69`
     - Merge dictionary with any other dictionary
     - Update student age to 18
     - Delete grades
     - List all keys
     - List all values
     - Iterate and print all keys
     - Iterate and print all values
     - Iterate and print both keys value pairs
     - Remove all items
5. Create an empty set `set1` and assign it to a variable.
     - Add three items
     - Create a second set `set2` with at least one common item with the first set
     - Find the union, symmetric difference, and intersection of the two sets
     - Create a sequence of numbers using range, then ask the user to enter a number.
          - Inform the user whether or not their number was within the specified range.

17. Reverse the order of the digits `5893804115457289` using list.
18. Print values in list along with its index `nums = [2,7,11,15]`
