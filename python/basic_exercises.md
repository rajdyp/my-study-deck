     - Remove all items
5. Create an empty set `set1` and assign it to a variable.
     - Add three items
     - Create a second set `set2` with at least one common item with the first set
     - Find the union, symmetric difference, and intersection of the two sets
     - Create a sequence of numbers using range, then ask the user to enter a number.
