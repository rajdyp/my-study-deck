<details>
<summary> Contains duplicate </summary>

```yaml
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every
element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
```

<details>
<summary> Valid anagram </summary>

```yaml
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the
original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
 
Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
```

<details>
<summary> Two sum </summary>

```yaml
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to
target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 
Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- Only one valid answer exists.
```
