## Arrays

- [Find the maximum and minimum element in an array.](https://github.com/rajdyp/rajdyp.github.io/blob/master/python/solutions/max_and_min_in_an_array.md)
```yaml
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
Maximum element: 9
Minimum element: 1
