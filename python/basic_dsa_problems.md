# Basic DSA problems

## Arrays

1. [Find the maximum and minimum element in an array.](https://github.com/rajdyp/rajdyp.github.io/blob/master/python/solutions/max_and_min_in_an_array.md)
```yaml
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
Maximum element: 9
Minimum element: 1
```
2. [Reverse an array.]()
```yaml
Given an array of integers, write a function that reverses the elements of the array in place.
(i.e. modify the original array without using additional data structures)
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

3. Find the sum of all elements in an array.
4. Find the second largest element in an array.
5. Check if an array is sorted.
6. Remove duplicates from a sorted array.
7. Rotate an array to the right by K positions.
