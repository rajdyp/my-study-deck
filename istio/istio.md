#### ServiceEntry
Add additional entries to Istioâ€™s internal service registry and make external services or internal services that are not part of our mesh look like part of our service mesh.

#### EnvoyFilter 
- Allows to customize the Envoy configuration that gets generated by the Istio Pilot. 
- Using EnvoyFilter we can update values, add specific filters, or even add new listeners, clusters, etc. 

## Discovery Selectors
- By default, Istio control plane watches and processes updates for all Kubernetes resources in a cluster. 
- Discovery selectors allow us to control which namespaces Istio control plane watches and sends configuration updates for.
- We can update the IstioOperator to include the discoverySelectors field as shown below:

```yml
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
metadata:
  namespace: istio-system
  name: istio-demo
spec:
  meshConfig:
    discoverySelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        env: test
```
